# VoiceBased-Web-Browser
The purpose of this project is to provide an alternative to traditional mouse and keyboard approach to web browsing. In this project, browsing the web is made efficient  using just voice controls. 

The reason for this project's development is primarily to accommodate the differently abled section of our society. As they are neglected and new technologies are not always accessible to everyone. Hence in this project we focused on accessibility and ease of use. The UI can now be navigated by those who are either not familiar with keyboard and mouse, or can't physically use it.
